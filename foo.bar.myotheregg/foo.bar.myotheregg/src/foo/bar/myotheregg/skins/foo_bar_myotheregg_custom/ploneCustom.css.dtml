/* DOCUMENTATION ON PRE-DEFINED PROPERTIES FROM PLONE */

 /* You can insert colors and other variables from Plone's 
    base_properties by doing:
    
    & dtml-variableName ; (without the spaces, excluded here to not make it render)
    
    Example:
    
    myLink {
        color: & dtml-fontColor ;   (again, without the spaces)
    }
 
   This means you can generate your own elements that use Plone's defaults,
   and respect any customizations people have done. See base_properties for
   the default values.
